# Gray Map and Helberg Code Usage

## Introduction

DNA-based data storage systems have evolved as a solution to accommodate data explosion. In this project, an excellent class of single error correction VT code and multiple error correct Helberg codes are considered with the deletion sphere as a decoding algorithm. Both the codes give interesting properties when mapped with the Gray map and asymmetric permutation of the Gray map. Reduction codes and Torsion codes are also explored in the context of the Helberg code.
